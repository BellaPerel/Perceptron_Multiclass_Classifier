Certainly, the PerceptronClassifier class is designed to implement a multiclass perceptron classifier for machine learning tasks. It enables the training of the classifier using a provided training dataset (X and y) and subsequently makes predictions based on the learned model.
During training, the class iteratively refines the model's weights to correctly classify data points into multiple classes.
Once trained, the model can be used to predict the class labels of new data points.
The accuracy of the model's predictions can also be evaluated on the training data.
This class encapsulates the core functionality of a perceptron classifier, making it a useful tool for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
